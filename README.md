## Lists
-Just add a dash first and then write a text.

-If you add another dash in the following line, you will have another item in the list.
    - If you add four spaces or use a tab key, you will create an indented list.
        - If you need sert an indenta list within an intended one, just press a tab key again.

Sometimes you want bullet points:

*Start a line with a star 
*Profit!
